Voting
======

Voting is a way to collect voluntary uage information using firebase. Visitors can view votes anytime, but must login with github to weigh in. Auth is handled by passport, so you can use any of their 100+ authentication strategies. 

This project is being conceived as a followup to [a session](https://github.com/apicraft/detroit2013/wiki/What-can-we-use-from-HTTP%3F) at the 2013 [API Craft Conference](http://apicraft.org) which asked the question: "What should we be borrowing from the HTTP spec when designing apis?"
